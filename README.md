## 📝 Project Description
This project focuses on building a **Credit Risk Prediction Model** to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The model is trained on historical financial data and uses machine learning techniques to predict credit risk. It is designed to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.
